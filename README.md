## **Introduction**

This Python program approximates the value of Pi using an **Archimedean Algorithm**, where Pi is calculated by inscribing an n-sided polygon inside a circle and then measuring the perimeter. The more sides the polygon has, the closer the approximation of Pi gets to the true value. The application visualizes the inscribed polygon and circle, showing the relationship between the shape and the calculated Pi value.

## **Archimedean Algorithm Explained**

### **How the Algorithm Works**

The **Archimedean Algorithm** for Pi approximation relies on the geometric idea that as the number of sides of a regular polygon inscribed in a circle increases, the perimeter of the polygon approaches the circumference of the circle.

Archimedes of Syracuse, one of the most famous ancient Greek mathematicians, used this method to find an approximate value of Pi. He compared the perimeters of polygons with increasing numbers of sides (both inscribed and circumscribed) and used these as bounds for Pi.

### **Mathematical Formula**

Given an `n`-sided regular polygon inscribed in a circle with diameter `d`, the length of each side of the polygon can be calculated using trigonometry. The perimeter of the polygon is:

\[
\text{Perimeter} = n \times \text{side\_length}
\]

The length of each side `s` of the polygon is given by:

\[
s = 2 \times r \times \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( r = \frac{d}{2} \) is the radius of the circle.
- \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon.

To approximate Pi, we divide the perimeter of the polygon by the diameter of the circle:

\[
\pi \approx \frac{\text{Perimeter}}{d} = \frac{n \times \left(2 \times r \times \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)\right)}{d}
\]

As the number of sides \( n \) increases, this approximation gets closer to the true value of Pi.

### **Visualization**

In the diagram below, a polygon with `n` sides is inscribed inside a circle. As `n` increases, the perimeter of the polygon approaches the circumference of the circle.

As the number of sides grows:
1. A 3-sided polygon (triangle) gives a very rough estimate of Pi.
2. A 100-sided polygon provides a much better approximation.

## **Features**

- **Modern UI**: The application uses `ttkbootstrap` to give a fresh, responsive design, inspired by Bootstrap.
- **Pi Approximation**: Calculate Pi using the Archimedean method with different polygon sizes.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: View a real-time plot of the inscribed polygon and circle for better understanding.
- **Customizable**: Choose the number of sides of the polygon and the circle's diameter.
